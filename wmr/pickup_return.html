                <h1>Important Notice</h1>
                <p>***There is a toll pass in the car which gives a discount to any toll lanes, but you're 
                required to pay all tolls, parking, tickets, etc. Including the parking fee coming out of DIA.</p>
                <p>***Any pick-ups and drop-offs from DIA may be from any lot, whether that be the Garage, East 
                Economy, West Economy, or Pikes Peak Lot. We will specify as we drop off the car. YOU WILL BE 
                RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PARKING FEES COMING OUT OF THE AIRPORT. Fees will vary from $8-$30 depending 
                on lot, and pickup time required.</p>

            <p>***YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PARKING FEES EXITING DENVER AIRPORT*** Depending on parking 
                availability, we may drop off the car either in the garage, the economy lot, or even the Pikes Peak 
                lot. We will confirm as we go to drop off the car. There will be a lock box on the driver's window 
                with the keys inside. Once you have located the car, we will ask you for a selfie of you and the car 
                behind you, and we will text you the code to open the lockbox. In the lockbox, you will find a black 
                faraday pouch with the key fob inside. Once the key is out of the pouch you will be able to unlock 
                the car. Upon getting in the car please remove the lockbox by carefully rolling down the window while 
                holding the lockbox to free the lockbox from its place. Feel free to put the lock box wherever is 
                convenient for you (glove box, trunk, backseat floor, etc.). Keep the black faraday pouch either in 
                the (unlocked) box or somewhere you can access it as you will need it for the return process. We will 
                leave the ticket in the car as you will need it to pay for parking as you leave.</p>

            <h2>RETURN INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <p>When you return, please return to the same lot you received the car at. If not available, park in one 
                of the other lots (West Economy, East Economy, Pikes Peak lot, or Garage) and message us a photo of 
                identifying features of the location of the car so we know where it is. Leave the ticket you got for 
                parking in the car when you leave so we can get out of the lot. Please make sure all of your personal 
                belongings are out of the vehicle, place the key fob back into the faraday pouch, velcro it shut, and 
                put it in the center console of the vehicle. Don't worry about putting the lockbox back on the window. 
                Feel free to leave it in the car. To lock the car, press the 'lock' button on either of the front doors 
                and make sure all doors are shut. At that point, please ensure that all doors are locked.</p>
