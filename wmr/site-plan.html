      <h3>Pickup/Return</h3>
      <p>Specific instructions on how to pick up our car when you 
        arrive and how to set it up as you return it!</p>
      <p>Important Notice</p>
      <p>***There is a toll pass in the car which gives a discount to any toll lanes, but you're 
        equired to pay all tolls, parking, tickets, etc. Including the parking fee coming out of DIA.</p>

      <p>***Any pick-ups and drop-offs from DIA may be from any lot, whether that be the Garage, East 
      Economy, West Economy,  or Pikes Peak Lot. We will specify as we drop off the car. YOU WILL BE 
      RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PARKING FEES COMING OUT OF THE AIRPORT. Fees will vary from $8-$30 
      depending on lot, and pickup time required.</p>

      <p>PICKUP INSTRUCTIONS</p>

        <p></p>***YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PARKING FEES EXITING DENVER AIRPORT***
        
        Depending on parking availability, we may drop off the car either in the garage, the economy 
        lot, or even the Pikes Peak lot. We will confirm as we go to drop off the car. There will be 
        a lock box on the driver's window with the keys inside. Once you have located the car, we 
        will ask you for a selfie of you and the car behind you, and we will text you the code to 
        open the lockbox. In the lockbox, you will find a black faraday pouch with the key fob inside. 
        Once the key is out of the pouch you will be able to unlock the car. Upon getting in the car 
        please remove the lockbox by carefully rolling down the window while holding the lockbox to 
        free the lockbox from its place. Feel free to put the lock box wherever is convenient for you 
        (glove box, trunk, backseat floor, etc.). Keep the black faraday pouch either in the (unlocked) 
        box or somewhere you can access it as you will need it for the return process. We will leave 
        the ticket in the car as you will need it to pay for parking as you leave.</p>
        
        
      <p>RETURN INSTRUCTIONS</p>
        
      <p>When you return, please return to the same lot you received the car at. If not available, 
        park in one of the other lots (West Economy, East Economy, Pikes Peak lot, or Garage) and 
        message us a photo of identifying features of the location of the car so we know where it is. 
        Leave the ticket you got for parking in the car when you leave so we can get out of the lot. 
        Please make sure all of your personal belongings are out of the vehicle, place the key fob back 
        into the faraday pouch, velcro it shut, and put it in the center console of the vehicle. Don't 
        worry about putting the lockbox back on the window. Feel free to leave it in the car. To lock 
        the car, press the 'lock' button on either of the front doors and make sure all doors are shut. 
        At that point, please ensure that all doors are locked.</p>
