    <h2>Grant Ware</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Grant! I live in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, USA. I love pretty much anything music!
        I play the piano and sing. I am going for a degree in Software Development to further my carrer and
        to give myself something to fall back on if my carrer falls through!</p>

    <p> I have been a member of the church my whole life! I served a mission in the St. George, Utah Mission, as well as the Canada Edmonton Mission as I was 
        reassigned because of COVID shutting the borders down. I just got home from my mission this past december!</p>

    <p>My favorite scripture would probably have to be Isaiah 61:1 which says, "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to
        preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison 
        to them that are bound". This was my mission scripture and is still something that I reflect on frequently.</p>
